# SICK-TiM7XX-3D-Scan
An application that utilizes a SICK TiM7XX LiDAR Scanner and 6 axis arm to generate a 3D scan of a surface. Requires the RoboDK API for robot control.

Files:
SICK_3D_Scan.py - Causes the robot arm to move the scanner along a surface in set steps, taking a single measurement scan each step

SICK_3D_Overscan.py - Causes the robot arm to move the scanner along a sruface in set steps, taking n number of scans each step and calculating the median for each data point. Requires pandas.

Scan_Lib/LiDAR_TiM7XX.py - Main library to communicate with and control the SICK TiM7XX scanner

Scan_lib/Polar_to_Cart.py - Helper library to take the polar coordinates generated by the LiDAR and convert them to Cartesion coordinates. Offsets are adjustable.
